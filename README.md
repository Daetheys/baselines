## Environment
The MineRL Diamond Challenge uses a custom distribution of Microsoft's Malmo Env. This environment as well as a random gym-style agent can be found in ```MINERL_HOME/minerl_env``` 

## Data
The MineRL Diamond Challenge leverages a large-scale dataset of human demonstrations - MineRLv0. To ensure access during evaluation, a python api is provided to load, filter, and map these demonstrations.
